*NOTE* Google does not allow Vimium to run on this Chrome Web Store page and the Chrome New Tab page, by design. Sorry about that!

*NOTE* Chrome has some alarmist messaging around the permissions that Vimium needs to run. Really all it's asking for is that Vimium's javascript be loaded into every page. Don't be alarmed. Vimium never talks to any servers and does absolutely nothing with your data. Read the open source code if you're curious.

For more information about rebinding your keys and how to use many of Vimium's features, see here: https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/README.md

Modifier keys are specified as <c-x>, <m-x>, <a-x> for ctrl+x, meta+x, and alt+x respectively.

Navigating the current page:

? show the help dialog for a list of all available keys
h scroll left
j scroll down
k scroll up
l scroll right
gg scroll to top of the page
G scroll to bottom of the page
d scroll down half a page
u scroll up half a page
f open a link in the current tab
F open a link in a new tab
r reload
gs view source
i enter insert mode -- all commands will be ignored until you hit esc to exit
yy copy the current url to the clipboard
yf copy a link url to the clipboard
gf cycle forward to the next frame

Navigating to new pages:

o Open URL, bookmark, or history entry
O Open URL, bookmark, history entry in a new tab
b Open bookmark

Using find:

/ enter find mode -- type your search query and hit enter to search or esc to cancel
n cycle forward to the next find match
N cycle backward to the previous find match

Navigating your history:

H go back in history
L go forward in history

Manipulating tabs:

J, gT go one tab left
K, gt go one tab right
g0 go to the first tab
g$ go to the last tab
t create tab
x close current tab
X restore closed tab (i.e. unwind the 'x' command)
T search through your open tabs

Additional advanced browsing commands:

]] Follow the link labeled 'next' or '>'. Helpful for browsing paginated sites.
[[ Follow the link labeled 'previous' or '<'. Helpful for browsing paginated sites.
<a-f> open multiple links in a new tab
gi focus the first (or n-th) text input box on the page
gu go up one level in the URL hierarchy

Vimium supports command repetition so, for example, hitting '5t' will open 5 tabs in rapid succession. ESC (or <c-[>) will clear any partial commands in the queue and will also exit insert and find modes.
